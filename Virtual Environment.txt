Definition:
   Virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environment for them.

Implementation:
   1. To create a virtual env use the following command:
      @ python -m venv ./venv
   2. To activate venv
      @ .\venv\Scripts\activate
   4. To deactivate venv
      @ deactivate

*** Option  ***
   1. Instead of venv we can give our virtualenv any name, but activating that name will be required
